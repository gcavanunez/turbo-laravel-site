      <p>A picture is worth a thousand words. Try the demo yourself to picture what a Hotwired app might feel like. Of course, this is a simple demo and Hotwired apps will definitely feel <em>very</em> different from one another. It all depends on how much progressive enhancements you're willing to trade-off.</p>
